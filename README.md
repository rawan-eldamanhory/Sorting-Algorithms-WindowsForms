# Sorting Algorithms – Windows Forms Application

## 📌 Overview
This project is a Windows Forms application that allows users to input an array and sort it using different sorting algorithms.  
Each algorithm includes a separate explanation window with examples to help understand how it works.

## 🧠 Implemented Algorithms
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Counting Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Radix Sort

## 🎯 Features
- User-defined array size and values
- Interactive sorting using multiple algorithms
- Explanation windows for each algorithm
- Educational examples and descriptions
- Clean and simple UI

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- C#
- .NET (Windows Forms)
- Visual Studio

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio
3. Build and run the project

## 📚 Purpose
This project was built to practice:
- Data structures and algorithms
- Desktop application development
- Writing clean and understandable code
- Explaining algorithms in a simple way

## 📌 Future Improvements
